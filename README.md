# Team-Profile-Generator 
The Team Profile Generator is a command-line-input application run in Node that requests information from the user about members of an engineering team and generates an HTML file displaying that information. Before running the application the user must perform an npm install to install all required dependencies.

When all information on the team member has been entered, the user is asked whether there are any more members they would like to add. If so, the user is asked the same questions about the new team member.

To get the app up and running on your Machine clone the repo or add the files individually. Make sure you run your "npm install" command then make sure you've installed inquirer. After that Run "Node App.js" and you'll get the questions shown above.
